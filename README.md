biz.jmaconsulting.simpleunsub
=============================

This extension is a utility which is used to hide the list of groups one would find when trying to unsubscribe from a mailing.

### The need for this extension

Clicking unsubscribe on a mailing sent via CiviCRM, would take one to a page listing out all the groups they are added to. These are the same groups to which the mailing was sent to. More often than not, the site owner may not choose to disclose the names of these groups to the end user as they may be senstive information or may confuse the user. In such cases, this extension can be used to provide a cleaner interface on the unsubscribe and resubscribe pages by hiding the list of groups and changing the message displayed to a more communicative one.
